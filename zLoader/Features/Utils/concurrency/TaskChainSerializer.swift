/*
 A serializer that queues tasks sequentially by chaining Task references.
 
 **Pros:**
 - Deadlock-free: Execution is managed inside a closure block, avoiding manual lock/unlock pairs. Even if the closure throws an error, the next task automatically runs.
 - Task cancellation support: Naturally propagates Swift Concurrency cancellations down the chain.
 - Simple API: Clean wrapper pattern (`try await serialize { ... }`).
